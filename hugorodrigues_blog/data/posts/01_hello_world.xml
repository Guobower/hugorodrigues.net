                Finally, my blog is online. Here I'm going to share my passion about technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest topics will be about <a href="https://odoo.com">Odoo</a>, an open-source business app suite, and Linux administration, but it will be another topics, I hope.

                My passion with Linux started around 2009, when my first laptop arrived. It's odd but it's true, my first laptop came with Linux Caixa MÃ¡gica, a Portuguese distribuition based on Ubuntu.
            </p>
            <p>
                But at the time, I was dependent on Windows (gamming on Linux was a dream) so I installed the Microsoft OS but always with the felling of exploring Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with Ubuntu 9.10 on a virtual machine and after a couple of weeks I jumped to a dualboot system. The time was passing by and I started to use more Linux than Windows, until I finished by professional course (High School). With that done, I was no longer working with .Net (and games on Linux was a real thing), so Windows wasn't needed anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this journey, I explored a lot of Linux distros, from Debian to Fedora, passing by OpenSUSE and Mangeia, but I finally calm down on Arch Linux. On Arch I was felling like localhost, I was in controll of my system, until a few weaks ago. I got bored and what did I do, I replaced Arch by Alpine on my laptop, just to try new stuff.

                I work with Odoo since I joined <a href="https://thinkopen.solutions">ThinkOpen Solutions</a> in 2016. I stared as a developer, building solutions for our clients. I worked with almost all base modules (Accouning, MRP, Warehouse, Events, etc) and even created some connectors to other plataforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                After almost a year, I was invited to be the system adminitrator for our Cloud service, since the previous one was leaving the company, and so I did. After a few monhts, I got promoted to Cloud Manager. In a year and a half, I was jumped from "the new guy" to manager of the Cloud Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time, I learned a lot about Odoo and started to like it. Today, I use it for everything, from my website (and now blog) to manage by projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                If by future is with Odoo, my dream is to work for Odoo SA, right in Belgium.
